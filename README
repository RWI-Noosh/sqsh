This repository is designed to make it very easy to install into a user's home
directory.  Simply clone into your home directory, name it to what you want
(perhaps .dotfiles?) and run install.sh to set up symlinks in your $HOME. Your
existing configurations will be backed up to $HOME/dotfile_$DATE.bak.tar.gz.
