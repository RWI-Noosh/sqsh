Not much to this: just my personal dotfiles collection. I generally don't
customize things too much since I like knowing the defaults and at most of my
jobs I've worked on a bunch of different servers. I'll often type in my needed
customizations on-the-fly.

This repository is designed to make it very easy to install into a user's home
directory.  Simply clone into your home directory, name it to what you want
(perhaps .dotfiles?) and run install.sh.
